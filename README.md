This demo make a set of images into gif. Each image use as a frame.

Usage:
Gif Encoder comes from https://github.com/ginsweater/gif-h, this is a c++ header file. So modify file's suffix with .mm which include it.

Gif Encoder needs raw image data with RGBA8, Alpha component ignored when processing. ImageHelper help to pick up raw data with RGBA8 format in Image.
